<h3>Does melatonin help treat and prevent jet lag?
</h3>
<h4><strong><big><u>Substance Definition</u></big><br>melatonin: </strong>"Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland from the amino acid tryptophan. The production and release of melatonin are stimulated by darkness and decreased by light, suggesting that melatonin is involved in circadian rhythm (the internal body clock) and regulation of diverse body functions. Levels of melatonin in the blood are highest prior to bedtime."
